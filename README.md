Identifying the type of crime based on its characteristics, such as location, time of day, and weapons used.


Machine learning algorithms are used to identify patterns in large datasets of crime data, such as incident reports, arrest records, and crime mapping data. These algorithms can be used to classify crimes based on their characteristics, predict where and when crimes are likely to occur, and identify factors that contribute to crime.
